This repo was created in the context of my master's thesis. Currently in standby since another solution was chosen.

## To be checked 

```console
45:12: found float, the usage of which is highly discouraged, as support for them varies across languages. Please consider serializing your float as string instead. If you are really sure you want to use them, re-run with crd:allowDangerousTypes=true
```

## TODO

- fix rendering of eligible regions in Status
